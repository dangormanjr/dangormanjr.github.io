Hello! My name is Daniel Gorman Jr. (Dan to friends), and I am a historian and history teacher. I specialize in nineteenth- and twentieth-century U.S. history, focusing on American religions, culture, and politics. This professional website provides links to my publications and other projects. 

Currently I am a history Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rochester. I received an M.A. in history from Rochester in 2017 and held an Andrew W. Mellon Digital Humanities Fellowship there from 2019â€“21. Previously I received an M.A. in history from Villanova University in 2016, and a B.A. in history and religion from the University of Rochester in 2014. I am a member of Phi Beta Kappa and a 2013 alumnus of the Beinecke Scholarship.
