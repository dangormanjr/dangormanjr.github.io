# Welcome #

Hello! My name is Daniel Gorman Jr. (Dan to friends), and I am a historian and history teacher. I specialize in nineteenth- and twentieth-century U.S. history, focusing on American religions, culture, and politics. This professional website provides links to my publications and other projects. 

Currently I am a history Ph.D. candidate and a 2019â€“21 Andrew W. Mellon Digital Humanities Fellow at the University of Rochester. Previously I received an M.A. in history from Villanova University, and a B.A. in history and religion from the University of Rochester. I am a member of Phi Beta Kappa and a 2013 alumnus of the Beinecke Scholarship. 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Ph.D. Dissertation: "Phantom Luminaries: Spiritualism and Paranormal Investigators in the Age of Disruption." Advisor: Joan Shelley Rubin, Rochester Dept. of History. 
- Assorted digital humanities projects as a Mellon Fellow.
- Philadelphia Jewish history, focusing on the cemetery of Har Hasetim, located in the suburb of Gladwyne. 
- The legacy of U.S. anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan.
- The 1893 Columbian Exposition and the beginnings of modern U.S. tourism.
- Project-based learning for history classrooms.
