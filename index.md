Hello! My name is Daniel Gorman Jr. (Dan to friends), and I am a historian and history teacher. I specialize in nineteenth- and twentieth-century U.S. history, focusing on American religions, culture, and politics. This professional website provides links to my publications and other projects. 

Currently I am a history Ph.D. candidate and a 2019â€“21 Andrew W. Mellon Digital Humanities Fellow at the University of Rochester. Previously I received an M.A. in history from Villanova University, and a B.A. in history and religion from the University of Rochester. I am a member of Phi Beta Kappa and a 2013 alumnus of the Beinecke Scholarship. 

## Current Interests and Projects

- Ph.D. Dissertation: "Phantom Luminaries: Spiritualism and Paranormal Investigators in the Age of Disruption." Advisor: Joan Shelley Rubin, Rochester Dept. of History. This dissertation focuses on the expulsion of a Spiritualist, Frederick Willis, from Harvard Divinity School in 1857, the ensuing public debate between Spiritualists and skeptics, and the connections between Spiritualism and broader religious currents of the nineteenth century.

- Assorted digital humanities projects as a Mellon Fellow. The purpose of the program is to gain a well-rounded understanding of digital tools and methods that humanists and social scientists can integrate into teaching and learning. Learn more about the Mellon Fellowship [here](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/humanities/fellowships/mellon.html).

- Project-based learning for history classrooms. 

- The 1893 Columbian Exposition and the beginnings of modern U.S. tourism.

- Philadelphia Jewish history, focusing on the cemetery of Har Hasetim, located in the suburb of Gladwyne. 

- The legacy of U.S. anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan.
