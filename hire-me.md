# HIRE ME

I am not seeking a full-time position at this time, but I am available for contract lecturing, copy editing, historical research, policy analysis, digital humanities consulting, and genealogical research. Past clients for whom I have done remote work include a staff writer for *The New Yorker* and a faculty member from UNSW Canberra at the Australian Defence Force Academy.
