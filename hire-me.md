I am available to do: 
- Historical research,  
- Contract lecturing, 
- Copy editing, 
- Policy analysis, 
- Digital humanities consulting, *and* 
- Genealogical research. 

Past clients for whom I have done remote work include a staff writer for *The New Yorker* and a faculty member from UNSW Canberra at the Australian Defence Force Academy.
